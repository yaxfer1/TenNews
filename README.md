Web Application of TenNews, fictional business developed for my final bachelor thesis (Javier Fern√°ndez Bellot) at Polythecnic University of Valencia.

This application is built with React; and the main functionalities of the app work with TypeScript and the states are managed with useReducer custom hooks.

However, functionalities associated with login and user status are working with JavaScript and managed with local states.

It interacts with the Back-End, developed with python(flask) to: retrieve and insert information of MySQL database; retrieve context of Pinecone RAG database; AI Chat functionalities and text generation to generate news articles.
