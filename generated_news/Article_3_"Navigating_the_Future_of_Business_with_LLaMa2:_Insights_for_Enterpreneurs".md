## Contexts

## LLaMA-2 LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) consists of a series of base language models with a parameter count ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion. These base models are solely trained to opti- mize the likelihood of next-word prediction in the language modeling task. For a fair comparison, we employ the same prompt for LLaMA-2 as used for Dromedary-2.
LLaMA-2-Chat LLaMA-2-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b) is an adaptation tailored for dialogue applications. The initial stage of development utilized Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with a collec- tion of 27,540 annotations. For reward modeling, the new human preference annotations for safety and helpfulness reached a count of 1,418,091. In its Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) progression, it transitioned from RLHF-V1 to RLHF-V5, reflecting enriched human pref- erence data. The model predominantly employed Rejection Sampling fine-tuning up to RLHF-V4. Thereafter, it is trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to produce RLHF-V5.

## While there have been exciting breakthroughs and applications of LLMs, most leading LLMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023), and Claude (Claude, 2023) remain closed-sourced. Developers and researchers have limited access to the full model parameters, making it difficult for the community to deeply study or fine-tune these systems. More openness and transparency around LLMs could accelerate research and responsible development within this rapidly advancing field. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), a series of large language models developed by Meta containing up to 65 billion parameters, has significantly benefited the LLM research community by being fully open- sourced. The open nature of LLaMA, along with other open-source LLMs such as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), enables researchers to freely access the models for examination, experimentation, and further development. This transparency and access distinguishes LLaMA from other proprietary LLMs. By providing full access, the open-source LLMs have accelerated research

Aquila2 represents a language model series devised by BAAI, noted for surpassing comparable models in terms is of performance [22], and the Aquila2-34B chat model employed in this research. LLaMA2 constitutes a suite of pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs, with scales ranging from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters [17]. Following additional training, LLaMA2-70B is incorporated into Xinyu2-70B.

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations (Section 5.2) Llama 2 is a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2âs potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their speciï¬c applications of the model. Please see the Responsible Use Guide available available at https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-user-guide

them directly is currently out of reach for LLMs [4]. Second, one needs to align the large foundation models to answer the domain-speciï¬c questions. Due to the large scale, fully training these models is not possible, and even middle-ground solutions such as ï¬ne-tuning LLMs require substantial compute and engineering investments [7]. Last but not least, any use of LLMs in business-critical operations, should have solutions when âthings go wrongâ, including diagnosing of and recovering from mistakes and hallucinations [8].

# 2 Background

## Ethical evaluation of LLMs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered signiï¬cant attention due to their powerful natural language processing capabilities, enabling tasks such as text translation [37] and summarization [38]. Prominent examples of LLMs include OpenAIâs ChatGPT [1] and GPT-4 [2], Googleâs Bard [39] and PaLM [40], Metaâs LLaMa [3], among others. While these models offer numerous beneï¬ts, researchers have also identiï¬ed potential ethical risks associated with their usage. Notably, the existing evaluation work on LLMs predominantly focuses on their linguistic performance, with limited emphasis on ethical considerations. Several studies, such as HELM [23] and the ethical considerations of ChatGPT [24], have explored the ethical dimensions of large language models. However, HELMâs evaluation lacks the assessment of the latest LLMs and relies on previous simplistic evaluation methods.

Language models are pivotal in computer science, evolving from statistical language models, to neural language models, to pre-trained language models (PLMs), and now to the current generation of LLMs. The advent of models such as Chat- GPT has seen contemporary LLMs exhibit new capabilities in handling complex tasks. These models can manage few- shot tasks via in-context learning and tackle mixed tasks by following instructions [1]. LLMs can be classified according to two dimensions. The first dimension concerns the openness of the model weights. For example, open-source models include Metaâs LLaMA [17], Tsinghua Universityâs GLM [12], and Alibabaâs Qwen [14], while closed-source models feature OpenAIâs GPT [20], Baiduâs ERNIE Bot [31], and Anthropicâs Claude 5, among others. The second dimension differentiates between the use of a PLM or a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model for specific inferences. A PLM is a language model trained on extensive unlabeled textual data to discern under- lying patterns, structures, and semantic knowledge within the corpus. Conversely, an SFT model involves further training a PLM with labeled
